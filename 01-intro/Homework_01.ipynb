       "\"To execute a command in a running Docker container, you can use the `docker exec` command. This command allows you to run a new command in the context of an existing container. Here are the basic steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify the Container ID or Name:** First, you need to identify the container where you want to execute the command. You can do this with the `docker ps` command, which lists all running containers.\\n\\n    ```sh\\n    docker ps\\n    ```\\n\\n    This will output a list of running containers, including their IDs and names.\\n\\n2. **Execute the Command:** Once you have the container ID or name, you can use the `docker exec` command to run the desired command inside the container. The general syntax is:\\n\\n    ```sh\\n    docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]\\n    ```\\n\\n    - `OPTIONS`: You can use various options such as `-it` for interactive terminal.\\n    - `CONTAINER`: The ID or name of the running container.\\n    - `COMMAND`: The command you want to execute.\\n    - `[ARG...]`: (Optional) Arguments for the command.\\n\\n    For example, to open a bash shell in an interactive mode inside a container named `my_container`:\\n\\n    ```sh\\n    docker exec -it my_container /bin/bash\\n    ```\\n\\n    If you simply want to run a non-interactive command, you can do so without `-it`. For example, to list the contents of the `/var` directory inside the container:\\n\\n    ```sh\\n    docker exec my_container ls /var\\n    ```\\n\\n### Examples\\n\\n1. **Run an Interactive Shell:**\\n\\n    ```sh\\n    docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/bash\\n    ```\\n\\n    or if the container uses `sh` instead of `bash`:\\n\\n    ```sh\\n    docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/sh\\n    ```\\n\\n2. **Run a Single Command:**\\n\\n    ```sh\\n    docker exec <container_id_or_name> ps aux\\n    ```\\n\\n3. **Run a Command with Arguments:**\\n\\n    ```sh\\n    docker exec <container_id_or_name> ls -la /var/log\\n    ```\\n\\n### Important Options\\n\\n- `-i`: Keep STDIN open even if not attached.\\n- `-t`: Allocate a pseudo-TTY.\\n- `-u`: Specify the username or UID to use.\\n\\n### Tips\\n\\n- Make sure that the command you're trying to run is available inside the container.\\n- For `root` access, ensure you have appropriate permissions or use the `-u root` option if required.\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nUsing `docker exec` is a versatile way to interact with a running container or to run specific commands within it. It is especially useful for debugging, maintenance, and administrative tasks.\""

      "question: Docker - docker pull dbpage\n",
      "answer: Whenever a `docker pull is performed (either manually or by `docker-compose up`), it attempts to fetch the given image name (pgadmin4, for the example above) from a repository (dbpage).\n",
      "IF the repository is public, the fetch and download happens without any issue whatsoever.\n",
      "For instance:\n",
      "docker pull postgres:13\n",
      "docker pull dpage/pgadmin4\n",
      "BE ADVISED:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Docker Images we'll be using throughout the Data Engineering Zoomcamp are all public (except when or if explicitly said otherwise by the instructors or co-instructors).\n",
      "\n",
      "Meaning: you are NOT required to perform a docker login to fetch them. \n",
      "\n",
      "So if you get the message above saying \"docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied. That is most likely due to a typo in your image name:\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance:\n",
      "$ docker pull dbpage/pgadmin4\n",
      "Will throw that exception telling you \"repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'\n",
      "Error response from daemon: pull access denied for dbpage/pgadmin4, repository does not exist or \n",
      "may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied\n",
      "But that actually happened because the actual image is dpage/pgadmin4 and NOT dbpage/pgadmin4\n",
      "How to fix it:\n",
      "$ docker pull dpage/pgadmin4\n",
      "EXTRA NOTES:\n",
      "In the real world, occasionally, when you're working for a company or closed organisation, the Docker image you're trying to fetch might be under a private repo that your DockerHub Username was granted access to.\n",
      "For which cases, you must first execute:\n",
      "$ docker login\n",
      "Fill in the details of your username and password.\n",
      "And only then perform the `docker pull` against that private repository\n",
      "Why am I encountering a \"permission denied\" error when creating a PostgreSQL Docker container for the New York Taxi Database with a mounted volume on macOS M1?\n",

      "1- Stop Rancher Desktop:\n",
      "If you are using Rancher Desktop and face this issue, stop Rancher Desktop to resolve compatibility problems.\n",
      "2- Install Docker Desktop:\n",
